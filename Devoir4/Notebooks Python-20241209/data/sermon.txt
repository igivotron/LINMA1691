Jesus went about in all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people. The report about him went out into all Syria. They brought to him all who were sick, afflicted with various diseases and torments, possessed with demons, epileptics,  and  paralytics;  and  he  healed  them. Great  multitudes  from  Galilee,  Decapolis,  Jerusalem,  Judea and from beyond the Jordan followed him.

Seeing the multitudes, he went up onto the mountain. When he had sat down, his disciples came to him. He opened his mouth and taught them, saying:  

Blessed are the poor in spirit,  for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.d 

Blessed are those who mourn,  for they shall be comforted.  

Blessed are the gentle,  for they shall inherit the earth. 

Blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled.  

Blessed are the merciful,  for they shall obtain mercy.  

Blessed are the pure in heart,  for they shall see God.  

Blessed are the peacemakers,  for they shall be called children of God.  

Blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousnessâ€™ sake, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.

Blessed are you when people reproach you, persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven. For that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
